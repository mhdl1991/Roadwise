##Roadwise

A demo built for the RAI Hackathon

Currently just a mockup for a hopefully larger project, and also a way for me to learn how to make things with .NET MAUI

It's supposed to be an app that takes data from the surroundings and historic data and informs the user if a road is safe or if there's a likelihood of accident or injury
